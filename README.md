# Recommendation-systems
Recommendation Systems This is a workshop on using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques to build Recommendation Systesm  Theory: ML &amp; DL Formulation, Prediction vs. Ranking, Similiarity, Biased vs. Unbiased Paradigms: Content-based, Collaborative filtering, Knowledge-based, Hybrid and Ensembles Data: Tabular, Images, Text (Sequences) Models: (Deep) Matrix Factorisation, Auto-Encoders, Wide &amp; Deep, Rank-Learning, Sequence Modelling Methods: Explicit vs. implicit feedback, User-Item matrix, Embeddings, Convolution, Recurrent, Domain Signals: location, time, context, social, Process: Setup, Encode &amp; Embed, Design, Train &amp; Select, Serve &amp; Scale, Measure, Test &amp; Improve Tools: python-data-stack: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras, spacy, implicit, lightfm Notes &amp; Slides Basics: Deep Learning AI Conference 2019: WhiteBoard Notes | In-Class Notebooks Notebooks Movies - Movielens  01-Acquire 02-Augment 03-Refine 04-Transform 05-Evaluation 06-Model-Baseline 07-Feature-extractor 08-Model-Matrix-Factorization 09-Model-Matrix-Factorization-with-Bias 10-Model-MF-NNMF 11-Model-Deep-Matrix-Factorization 12-Model-Neural-Collaborative-Filtering 13-Model-Implicit-Matrix-Factorization 14-Features-Image 15-Features-NLP Ecommerce - YooChoose  01-Data-Preparation 02-Models News - Hackernews  Product - Groceries  Python Libraries Deep Recommender Libraries  Tensorrec - Built on Tensorflow Spotlight - Built on PyTorch TFranking - Built on TensorFlow (Learning to Rank) Matrix Factorisation Based Libraries  Implicit - Implicit Matrix Factorisation QMF - Implicit Matrix Factorisation Lightfm - For Hybrid Recommedations Surprise - Scikit-learn type api for traditional alogrithms Similarity Search Libraries  Annoy - Approximate Nearest Neighbour NMSLib - kNN methods FAISS - Similarity search and clustering Learning Resources Reference Slides Deep Learning in RecSys by Bal√°zs Hidasi Lessons from Industry RecSys by Xavier Amatriain Architecting Recommendation Systems by James Kirk Recommendation Systems Overview by Raimon and Basilico Benchmarks MovieLens Benchmarks for Traditional Setup Microsoft Tutorial on Recommendation System at KDD 2019 Algorithms &amp; Approaches Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets Bayesian Personalised Ranking for Implicit Data Logistic Matrix Factorisation Neural Network Matrix Factorisation Neural Collaborative Filtering Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering Evaluations Evaluating Recommendation Systems
